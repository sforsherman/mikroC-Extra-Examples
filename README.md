# mikroC-Extra-Examples
This repository will contain extra examples and code libraries that I have researched &amp; develop on before. For now, it will contain the INA219 library which was replicated over from the original Adafruit INA219 library. More libraries and examples will be added in the near future.

# Instructions
To load the examples into your mikroC development environment, just clone the repo, or download the zip file and extract it to a location on your desktop, and then copy the root folder(s) to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Mikroelektronika\mikroC PRO for PIC\Examples\Development Systems\EASYPIC7\"

Now launch your mikroC PRO for PIC and you will be able to load the example from the "Examples section".
